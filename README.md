# JavaScript_Math_Visualization
JavaScript examples to demonstrate the process of using math occurrence frequencies to make sense of data.

Math Visualization uses mathematics principles to make sense of the data contained in a file.
It does this by analyzing number digits.
For Example, a 4 digit number like 1946 is probably a year; a 2 or 3 digit number like 18 or 103 is probably age. A year followed by age is probably a birthday.
The scripts are written in JavaScript and make use of JS libraries JQuery and Ajax.
The scripts are written by Vakindu Philliam.
